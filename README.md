# Development <br/>
The game was created by members of the Chrome UX team in 2014, which consisted of Sebastien Gabriel, Alan Bettes, and Edward Jung.<br/>
Gabriel designed the player character, named the "Lonely T-Rex".During development, the game was given the codename "Project Bolan",<br/> in reference to Marc Bolan, the lead singer of the T. Rex band. The developers chose the dinosaur theme as a reference to the game's function,<br/> a joke that not having an internet connection is equivalent to living in the "prehistoric ages". The game was released in September 2014; initially, it did not work on older devices, so the code was updated and re-released in December of the same year.<br/> The pteranodons were added as obstacles with a browser update in 2015.<br/>
